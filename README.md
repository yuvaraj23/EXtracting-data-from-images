# Extracting-data-from-images

Extracting text from a noise image is a fairly hard thing. Optical Character Recognition is a process when images of handwritten, printed, or typed text are converted into machine-encoded text. Automated recognition of documents, bill receipts, credit cards, car plates, and billboards significantly simplifies the way we collect and process data.
The goal of our project was to develop an api using the flask for receipt recognition. Let's take a closer look.
